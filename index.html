      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>Hello, my name is Josiah. I was originally born in Buffalo, NY. Home of the buffalo wild wings ðŸ˜‹. I moved to Texas in 2015 with my mother. I finished my last two years of highschool in Richardson. After highschool, I moved to Melbourne, FL. I stayed there until 2020, when covid started. I didn't want my mother on her own at the height of the pandemic, so I moved back. I like going to the gym, going to the skating rink and occasionally the gun range. </p>
      <p>I am a part time security officer for work. My current goal is to complete the bootcamp. Become a competent and confident web developer. </p>
